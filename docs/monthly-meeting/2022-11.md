## Agenda items

* (Alex) ["object doesn't have an `__enter__`/`__exit__` yet docs say it does"](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/97699) might be interesting to discuss

    - concern with renaming/changing text will break links (specifically, fragment parts of URL e.g. `#object.__enter__`).
    - it's better to add a paragraph above explaining it. even though readers may not read the paragraph, at least we can still point people to it, instead of breaking links.


- Infrastructure & detecting/avoiding broken links
    - how to get visibility of docs traffic and broken url hits?
        - First step: ask [#PSF category on Discourse](https://discuss.python.org/c/python-software-foundation/9).
        - Done, see [Discourse thread](https://discuss.python.org/t/data-on-requests-for-missing-urls-in-docs-python-org-etc/20841) â€”JDLH
        - Probably Ee [@EWDurbin](https://discuss.python.org/u/ewdurbin/summary) oversees this, but better not to start there, Ee is busy.
    - need help from Ee about docs preview on Netlify
    - [`sphinxext-rediraffe`](https://sphinxext-rediraffe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) can check at the source level
* (Hugo) [Add release cycle chart to docs](https://github.com/python/docs-community/issues/67)
  * **Ezio**: fix conflicts in [python/devguide#884](https://github.com/python/devguide/pull/884)
  * Then, merge the chart generation
